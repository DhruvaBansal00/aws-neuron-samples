# Training and Inference Examples for Hugging Face Transformers and AWS Neuron (`Inf1`, `Inf2`, `Trn1`)

This repository contains instructions/examples/tutorials using the `neuron-sdk` for running inference and training Hugging Face libraries like [transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index), [datasets](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/index) with AWS Accelerators including [AWS Inferentia](https://aws.amazon.com/de/machine-learning/inferentia/) & [AWS Trainium](https://aws.amazon.com/de/machine-learning/trainium/).

### Inference
